I am willing to work on the Narseen Mohamedi 'untitled-1' from the listed artworks.
I developed some ideas and the will to choose this one when I was browsing some interactive designs of p5. I got inspired by a project where there are two platforms drawn on the sketch and users can do interactions by clicking the page to add squares, which will drop at the platforms or fall down.
Narseen Mohanmedi's artwork is in minimalism style with several geometry figures. I think it's interesting to add some animations and design the interaction where users can add or change figures in the screen to interfere the movement or the shape of the initial picture.
