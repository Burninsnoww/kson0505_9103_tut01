I am willing to work on the Narseen Mohamedi 'untitled-1' from the listed artworks.
I developed some ideas and the will to choose this one when I was browsing some interactive designs of p5. I got inspired by a project where there are two platforms drawn on the sketch and users can do interactions by clicking the page to add squares, which will drop at the platforms or fall down.
Narseen Mohanmedi's artwork is in minimalism style with several geometry figures. I think it's interesting to add some animations and design the interaction where users can add or change figures in the screen to interfere the movement or the shape of the initial picture.

Basically My idea can be realized through javascript. To reappear the original art work and make some animations, I will probably use the 3D and 2D methods from p5. Some functions like box() and ellipse() will surely be seen in my coding. To make it a little more creative, I want to make the geometry looks 3D during the movement like rotating and translations.
